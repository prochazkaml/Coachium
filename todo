- make the chart display more than 1 sensor
- calculation of area between 2 functions
	- fitted function or axis (with offset) can also be selected as a source
	- snapping to intersection points
- implement sine fitting (at least some primitive kind which only works properly on sine waves)
- function manager for adding custom functions
- dedicated port popup (for enlarging a value of a given sensor)
- allow selecting which sensor to use for fitting functions (in non-XY mode)
- get rid of zoomed_in
- turn zoom?? into zoom.??
- if multiple sensors (in non-XY mode) - zoom.y1 and zoom.y2 = arrays
- fitted functions - use similar color to the captured data, dotted/dashed
- update_button_validity - only if the status changes! (otherwise it lags like shit)
- update z-index on click on draggable windows
- floating calculator
- chart export/capture setup - Tab doesn't work!
- get multiple popups to work

Future stuff:
- utility for analyzing data (optionally select a region, min/max/avg)
- show value on the graph when hovering over a data point
- enable "finish" trigger (use one of the sensors for stopping the capture)
- allow data limiting (remove up to a certain point, etc.) - auto recalculate fit if necessary
- ability to manually attach sensors
- ServiceWorker is a bit wonky?
- playing back the captured data as audio (mono/stereo)
- computer's audio input as a sensor
- counter mode
- sensor calibration
- 40 kHz capture on €Lab
- cyclic buffer on €Lab
- oscilloscope mode
- some interfaces have outputs as well as inputs, so be able to control them as well
- support more devices I could get access to (CoachLab, €Lab with motion (or whatever it's called), etc.)
- support more devices I would have to beg for (non-CMA stuff)
- translate to more languages than just English or Czech
- importing legacy CMR files from Coach
- the canvas is a blurry mess when the display scaling is not exactly 100 %
