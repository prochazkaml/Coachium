Required for initial testing (current–voltage characteristic of diodes):
- show value on the graph when hovering over a data point
- actual window spawning/despawning (to prevent tabbing over to the next window!!!)
- remove unused windows
- update output file format
- put the port panel on the right side
- make the capture system tabbed
- make the windows JS-generated (make some sort of toolkit)
- break up ui.js and mainwindow.js, they're too big
- remove trailing spaces/tabs from all source files!!!
- embed everything in a single file (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts...) - ideally compress everything, store it in raw binary
- do not wait for GitHub/Google Drive
- make the capture progress not use Array.push, as it's way too slow
- use get_* as much as possible (even in chains), replace getElement(s)ByWhatever

******************************************************-
- UNCOMMENT GDRIVE.HTML!
******************************************************-

Future stuff:
- drawing XY as double X
- ability to manually attach sensors
- trigger (conditional capture) mode
- moving the windows around
- add more functions to the fit function dialog (quadratic, sine etc.)
- playing back the captured data as audio (mono/stereo)
- computer's audio input as a sensor
- counter mode
- sensor calibration
- 40 kHz capture on €Lab
- cyclic buffer on €Lab
- oscilloscope mode
- some interfaces have outputs as well as inputs, so be able to control them as well
- support more devices I could get access to (CoachLab, €Lab with motion (or whatever it's called), etc.)
- support more devices I would have to beg for (non-CMA stuff)
- translate to more languages than just English or Czech
- importing legacy CMR files from Coach
- the canvas is a blurry mess when the display scaling is not exactly 100 %
