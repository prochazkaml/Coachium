Required for initial testing:
- show value on the graph when hovering over a data point
- watchdog!!!
- ability to zero out a sensor

Future stuff:
- drawing XY as double X
- ability to manually attach sensors
- trigger (conditional capture) mode
- moving the windows around
- add more functions to the fit function dialog (quadratic, sine etc.)
- playing back the captured data as audio (mono/stereo)
- computer's audio input as a sensor
- counter mode
- sensor calibration
- 40 kHz capture on €Lab
- cyclic buffer on €Lab
- oscilloscope mode
- some interfaces have outputs as well as inputs, so be able to control them as well
- create a universal driver system for easily implementing more devices
- support more devices I could get access to (CoachLab, €Lab with motion (or whatever it's called), etc.)
- support more devices I would have to beg for (non-CMA stuff)
- support for more than 2 sensors
- translate to more languages than just English or Czech
- importing legacy CMR files from Coach
