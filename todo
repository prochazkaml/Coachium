- show value on the graph when hovering over a data point
- make the chart display more than 1 sensor
- enable "finish" trigger (use one of the sensors for stopping the capture)
- make the cache system work properly (had issues with Windows 11 & Chrome)
- calculation of area between 2 functions
	- fitted function or axis (with offset) can also be selected as a source
	- snapping to intersection points
- implement sine fitting
- function manager for adding custom functions
- dedicated port popup (for enlarging a value of a given sensor)
- make the table exportable into something useful
- refresh fit function dialog when selecting a different capture
- close fit function dialog at appropriate times
- display generated functions in the table (toggleable values)

Future stuff:
- ability to manually attach sensors
- playing back the captured data as audio (mono/stereo)
- computer's audio input as a sensor
- counter mode
- sensor calibration
- 40 kHz capture on €Lab
- cyclic buffer on €Lab
- oscilloscope mode
- some interfaces have outputs as well as inputs, so be able to control them as well
- support more devices I could get access to (CoachLab, €Lab with motion (or whatever it's called), etc.)
- support more devices I would have to beg for (non-CMA stuff)
- translate to more languages than just English or Czech
- importing legacy CMR files from Coach
- the canvas is a blurry mess when the display scaling is not exactly 100 %
