Does not require hardware:
- show value on the graph when hovering over a data point
- drawing XY as double X
- make the about and privacy policy pages use a similar translation system as the main page
- add more functions to the fit function dialog (quadratic, sine etc.)

Requires hardware:
- watchdog!!!
- trigger (conditional capture) mode
- counter mode
- ability to zero out a sensor
- ability to manually attach sensors
- 40 kHz capture on €Lab
- cyclic buffer on €Lab
- oscilloscope mode

Future stuff:
- create a universal driver system for easily implementing more devices
- support more devices I could get access to (CoachLab, €Lab with motion (or whatever it's called), etc.)
- support more devices I would have to beg for (non-CMA stuff)
- support for more than 2 sensors
- translate to more languages than just English or Czech
- importing legacy CMR files from Coach
