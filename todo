- allow for assignable proportions between waveforms
- use drawcolors on the port's Y axis and immediate value (top right)
- use drawcolors on the BG of table header cells
- dialog for splitting captured data into separate captures (and XY mode)

Before submitting:
- make sure all comments correspond to the correct functions!
- run it through a HTML/CSS validator (both cached/uncached)!!!
- thoroughly verify that all features work as expected!

Future stuff:
- utility for analyzing data (optionally select a region, min/max/avg)
- dedicated port popup (for enlarging a value of a given sensor)
- cache system - one archive for raw binary data and one for scripts, HTML, CSS, SVG etc.?
- calculation of area between 2 functions
	- fitted function or axis (with offset) can also be selected as a source
	- snapping to intersection points
- function manager for adding custom functions
- show value on the graph when hovering over a data point
- enable "finish" trigger (use one of the sensors for stopping the capture)
- allow data limiting (remove up to a certain point, etc.) - auto recalculate fit if necessary
- option for displaying 2 (or more) curves side by side on separate charts
- ability to manually attach sensors
- add some visual content to the manual
- ServiceWorker is a bit wonky?
- playing back the captured data as audio (mono/stereo)
- computer's audio input as a sensor
- counter mode
- sensor calibration
- oscilloscope mode
- some interfaces have outputs as well as inputs, so be able to control them as well
- support more devices I could get access to (CoachLab, â‚¬Lab with motion (or whatever it's called), etc.)
- support more devices I would have to beg for (non-CMA stuff)
- translate to more languages than just English or Czech
- the canvas is a blurry mess when the display scaling is not exactly 100 %
- draw using WebGL (faster) - probably need to write a shader program?
- dark mode?
