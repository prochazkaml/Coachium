- show value on the graph when hovering over a data point
- make the chart display more than 1 sensor
- make the capture system tabbed
- the readout on the top right sometimes interferes with the axis
- enable "finish" trigger (use one of the sensors for stopping the capture)
- add scrot to homepage
- add shadows to the capture setup sensors

BUGS:
- trigger capture is fucked

Future stuff:
- ability to manually attach sensors
- moving the windows around
- add more functions to the fit function dialog (quadratic, sine etc.)
- playing back the captured data as audio (mono/stereo)
- computer's audio input as a sensor
- counter mode
- sensor calibration
- 40 kHz capture on €Lab
- cyclic buffer on €Lab
- oscilloscope mode
- some interfaces have outputs as well as inputs, so be able to control them as well
- support more devices I could get access to (CoachLab, €Lab with motion (or whatever it's called), etc.)
- support more devices I would have to beg for (non-CMA stuff)
- translate to more languages than just English or Czech
- importing legacy CMR files from Coach
- the canvas is a blurry mess when the display scaling is not exactly 100 %
