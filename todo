- make the chart display more than 1 sensor
- dedicated port popup (for enlarging a value of a given sensor)
- allow for assignable proportions between waveforms
- fitted functions - use similar color to the captured data
- cache - get rid of scripts.dat, unnecessary
- create an in-program manual (probably append to the "What is Coachium?" screen, pop up in a new window)

Before submitting:
- make all SVG icons the same width (looks fucky in popups)
- make sure all comments correspond to the correct functions!
- run it through a HTML/CSS validator (both cached/uncached)!!!
- thoroughly verify that all features work as expected!

Future stuff:
- calculation of area between 2 functions
	- fitted function or axis (with offset) can also be selected as a source
	- snapping to intersection points
- function manager for adding custom functions
- utility for analyzing data (optionally select a region, min/max/avg)
- fit sine function - calculate amplitude by area
- show value on the graph when hovering over a data point
- enable "finish" trigger (use one of the sensors for stopping the capture)
- allow data limiting (remove up to a certain point, etc.) - auto recalculate fit if necessary
- ability to manually attach sensors
- ServiceWorker is a bit wonky?
- playing back the captured data as audio (mono/stereo)
- computer's audio input as a sensor
- counter mode
- sensor calibration
- 40 kHz capture on €Lab
- cyclic buffer on €Lab
- oscilloscope mode
- some interfaces have outputs as well as inputs, so be able to control them as well
- support more devices I could get access to (CoachLab, €Lab with motion (or whatever it's called), etc.)
- support more devices I would have to beg for (non-CMA stuff)
- translate to more languages than just English or Czech
- importing legacy CMR files from Coach
- the canvas is a blurry mess when the display scaling is not exactly 100 %
