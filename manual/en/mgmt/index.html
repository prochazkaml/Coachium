<h1>Records Management</h1>

<p>
	Coachium allows you to edit or reorganize records after they are created.
	These actions are performed using the buttons on the action bar.
</p>

<h2>Switching between records</h2>

<p>
	If you create multiple records,
	you will probably want to go back to previous records.
	To do this, you can use the "View previous workbook record"
	or "View next workbook record"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('viewpreviousbutton').children[0].src;"> and
	<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('viewnextbutton').children[0].src;">)
	buttons.
</p>

<h2>Rename a record</h2>

<p>
	If you have a record currently selected that you want to rename,
	click the "Rename this record" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('renamecapturebutton').children[0].src;">)
	to display a text box pre-filled with the current name of the selected record.
	You can modify it and confirm your changes by clicking the "Rename" button.
</p>

<h2>Rearrange records</h2>

<p>
	If you find yourself in a situation where you've accidentally created records in the wrong order,
	don't worry. Clicking the "Manage Records" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('capturemgmtbutton').children[0].src;">)
	will bring up a window listing all of your records.
	From there, you can click on a record and use the arrows
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_class('L10N_TITLE_WINDOW13_UP').src;"> and
	<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_class('L10N_TITLE_WINDOW13_DOWN').src;">)
	in the bottom right corner of the window to move it up or down in order.
</p>

<p>
	You can also rename a record in this window.
	The current name of the selected record will automatically appear in the text box
	in the lower left corner of the window when you select it in the list.
	You can edit and sub-edit it (by clicking on
	<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_class('L10N_TITLE_WINDOW13_CONFIRM').src;">).
</p>

<h2>Viewing information about the record</h2>

<p>
	If you need to view information about the currently selected record
	and view its setting parameters or sensors used,
	you can find it in the "Record Details" window.
	This window is displayed when you click on the "Show details of this record" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('captureinfobutton').children[0].src;">).
</p>

<h2>Delete record</h2>

<p>
	If the currently selected record has failed, you can delete it.
	Click the "Delete this record from the workbook" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('removecapturebutton').children[0].src;">),
	confirm that you are sure, and the record will be gone forever.
</p>

<p>
	<b>WARNING</b>: This operation is irreversible!

</p>

<h2>Delete all records</h2>

<p>
	If your work really failed and you want to start over,
	click the "Discard all records and create a new record book"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('removeeverythingbutton').children[0].src;">),
	button to delete all your work and start with a clean record book.
