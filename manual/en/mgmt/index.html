<h1>Managing captures</h1>

<p>
	Coachium allows you to alter or reorganize captures after they are created.
	These actions are performed using the buttons on the action bar.
</p>

<h2>Switching between captures</h2>

<p>
	If you create multiple captures,
	you will probably want to go back to the previous ones.
	To do this, you can use the "Show the previous capture"
	or "Show the next capture" buttons
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('viewpreviousbutton').children[0].src;"> and
	<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('viewnextbutton').children[0].src;">).
</p>

<h2>Rename a capture</h2>

<p>
	If you have a capture currently selected that you want to rename,
	click the "Rename this capture" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('renamecapturebutton').children[0].src;">)
	to display a text box pre-filled with the current name of the selected capture.
	You can modify it and confirm your changes by clicking the "Rename" button.
</p>

<h2>Rearrange captures</h2>

<p>
	If you find yourself in a situation where you've accidentally created captures in the wrong order,
	don't worry. Clicking the "Manage captures" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('capturemgmtbutton').children[0].src;">)
	will bring up a window listing all of your captures.
	From there, you can click on a capture and use the arrows
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_class('L10N_TITLE_WINDOW13_UP').src;"> and
	<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_class('L10N_TITLE_WINDOW13_DOWN').src;">)
	in the bottom right corner of the window to move it up or down in order.
</p>

<p>
	You can also rename captures in this window.
	The current name of the selected capture will automatically appear in the text box
	in the lower left corner of the window when you select it in the list.
	You can edit it and confirm it by clicking on
	<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_class('L10N_TITLE_WINDOW13_CONFIRM').src;">.
</p>

<h2>Display information about the capture</h2>

<p>
	If you need to view information about the currently selected capture,
	view its setup parameters or see the sensors used,
	you can find it in the "Capture properties" window.
	This window is displayed when you click on the "Display this capture's details" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('captureinfobutton').children[0].src;">).
</p>

<h2>Delete a capture</h2>

<p>
	If you are not satisfied with the currently selected capture, you can delete it.
	Click the "Delete this capture" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('removecapturebutton').children[0].src;">),
	confirm that you are sure and the capture will be gone forever.
</p>

<p>
	<b>WARNING</b>: This operation is irreversible!
	Make sure you are deleting the correct capture!
</p>

<h2>Delete all captures</h2>

<p>
	If all your work did not come out the way you wanted to and you want to start over,
	click the "Remove all captures and create a new workbook" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('removeeverythingbutton').children[0].src;">),
	to delete all your work and start with a clean workbook.
</p>

	<b>WARNING</b>: This operation is irreversible!
	Be sure to back up your work, just in case!
