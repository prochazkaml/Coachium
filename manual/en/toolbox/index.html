<h1>Other instruments</h1>

<p>
	In addition to the record management and data manipulation functions,
	Coachium has several other useful tools. These tools can be found in the "Other tools"

<h2>Calculator</h2>

<p>
	A simple calculator. Enter an example in the text box
	(e.g., "460*29" or "sqrt(2)" to calculate the square root)
	and either press the Enter key, the equals sign key (=),
	or click the "=" button to the right of the text box.
	If you have entered a valid example,
	the result will appear in the text box in which you entered the example.
	If "ERROR" appears here, you probably made an error in entering the example.
</p>

<p>
	The calculator has a memory for history, it keeps both the entered examples
	(left aligned) and their results (right aligned).
	Click on an entry in the history to move its contents to a text box where you can continue working with it.
</p>

<p>
	For calculations with trigonometric functions,
	you need to select the correct angle units.
	Below the text box is a toggle switch that allows you to switch between
	degrees, radians (arc measure) or grads.
</p>

<p>
	The calculator rounds to 10 valid digits and can work with values
	from approx. -1.79769e+308 to approx. 1.79769e+308.
</p>

<h2>Unit converter</h2>

<p>
	A quick unit conversion tool, ideal for use with a calculator.
</p>

<p>
	In the top selection you can choose between different types of units
	(length, weight, etc.), below you can set the input and output unit.
	To perform the calculation, enter your value in the left text box,
	the result will appear on the right in the converted units.
</p>

<p>
	Like the calculator,
	the unit converter rounds to 10 valid digits and can handle values
	from approximately -1.79769e+308 to approximately 1.79769e+308.
