<h1>Getting familiar with the Coachium environment</h1>

<p>
	If you have a device connected (or you started the program in guest mode),
	Coachium will switch to its main interface. It is divided into several sections,
	which are described below.
</p>

<h2>Status bar</h2>

<p>
	Used to display the current status of the program -
	connection and disconnection of devices, whether a capture is currently running or has already finished,
	whether you are selecting a data area etc.
</p>

<p>
	Also includes a button to disconnect from the device or to reconnect to the device.
</p>

<h2>Action panel</h2>

<p>
	Contains all the options available to you -
	loading and saving files, starting and managing captures,
	data display settings etc.
</p>

<p>
	If a button is completely black, you can safely click on it.
	If it is greyed out,
	it is inactive and clicking it will not perform anything.
</p>

<p>
	You can learn more about these options in the following help chapters.
</p>

<h2>Main area</h2>

<p>
	Takes up most of the screen.
	This is where the captured data will be displayed
	(you can choose to display either as a graph or a table).
</p>

<h2>Side panel</h2>

<p>
	It shows all the available ports that the device is equipped with.
</p>

<p>
	If a sensor is connected to a port, that port will then "light up",
	display basic information about the sensor and periodically update with the current sensor value.
</p>

<p>
	By clicking on the connected sensor, you can zero out the sensor's value or restore its original zero value.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Note</b>: this panel is hidden in guest mode.
