<h1>Familiarising yourself with the Coachium environment</h1>

<p>
	If you have a device connected (or have run the program in guest mode),
	Coachium will open its main interface. It is divided into several sections,
	which are described below.
</p>

<h2>Status bar</h2>

<p>
	Used to display the current state of the program -
	connection and disconnection of devices, whether recording is in progress or finished,
	whether you are selecting a data area, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Also includes a button to disconnect from the device or to reconnect to the device. 
</p>

<h2>Action panel</h2>

<p>
	Contains all the options available to you -
	loading and saving files, starting and managing records,
	data display settings, etc.
</p>

<p>
	If the button is completely black, you can safely click on it.
	If it's more greyed out,
	it's inactive and clicking it will not perform anything.
</p>

<p>
	You can learn more about these options in the following help chapters.
</p>

<h2>Main area</h2>

<p>
	Takes up most of the screen.
	This is where the recorded data will be displayed if you record any
	(either as a graph or a table, you can choose).
</p>

<h2>Side panel</h2>

<p>
	It shows all the available ports that the device has.
</p>

<p>
	If a sensor is connected to a port, that port will "light up",
	displays basic information about the sensor and periodically updates with the current sensor value.
</p>

<p>
	By clicking on the connected sensor, you can reset the sensor or return it to its original value.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Note</b>: this panel is hidden in guest mode.
