<h1>Working with the chart or table</h1>

<p>
	If you have already created some captures and have them organized to your liking,
	you can now view the data.
	You can do this either with a chart or with a table -
	you can switch between the two by using the "Display capture data as a table" and "Display capture data as a chart" buttons
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('viewastablebutton').children[0].src;"> and
	<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('viewasgraphbutton').children[0].src;">).
</p>

<h2>Displaying data as a chart</h2>

<p>
	The best option for easy data visualization.
	If you have the mouse cursor positioned on the chart,
	controlling it is very simple:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drag the mouse with the left mouse button held down to move the currently zoomed area.</li>
	<li>Move the scroll wheel to zoom in or out on the chart.</li>
	<li>Move the scroll wheel with the Alt key held down to zoom in or out on the chart along the X axis only.</li>
	<li>Move the scroll wheel with the Shift key held down to zoom in or out on the chart along the Y axis only.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Zooming in onto an area</h3>

<p>
	If you want to zoom in on a specific area (and the precision of the scroll wheel is not enough),
	you can use the "Zoom into the chart" function
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('zoominbutton').children[0].src;">).
	Clicking this button activates the area selection mode.
	Move the mouse cursor over the chart,
	click on the point that becomes the upper left corner of the area,
	and then click on the second point that becomes the lower right corner of the area.
	The program will then zoom in perfectly on the area you have selected.
</p>

<h3>Automatically zoom to data</h3>

<p>
	To zoom in quickly and efficiently, press the "Zoom to data" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('zoomdatabutton').children[0].src;">).
	This function will automatically zoom in as optimally as possible on the captured data,
	while still making sure that all of it is visible.
</p>

<h3>Zooming out from the data</h3>

<p>
	To cancel the current zoom, click on the "Reset the zoom on the chart" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('zoomresetbutton').children[0].src;">).
	This will restore the original chart view.
</p>

<h2>Displaying data as a table</h2>

<p>
	The best option for accuracy. All measured values are entered in columns,
	where each sensor is assigned a separate column.
