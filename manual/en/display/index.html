<h1>Working with chart and table</h1>

<p>
	If you have already created some records and have them organized as you would like,
	you can now view the data.
	You can do this either in a chart or in a table -
	you can switch between the two using the "View record as table" and "View record as chart"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('viewastablebutton').children[0].src;"> and
	<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('viewasgraphbutton').children[0].src;">)
	buttons.
</p>

<h2>Viewing on a chart</h2>

<p>
	The best option for easy data visualization.
	If you have the mouse cursor positioned on the chart,
	controlling it is very simple:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drag the mouse with the left button held down to move the currently zoomed area.</li>
	<li>Move the mouse wheel to zoom in or out on the graph.</li>
	<li>Move the mouse wheel with the Alt key held down to zoom in or out on the graph along the X-axis only.</li>
	<li>Move the scroll wheel with the Shift key held down to zoom in or out on the graph along the Y axis only.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Zooming in on an area</h3>

<p>
	If you want to zoom in on a specific area (and the precision of the mouse wheel is not enough),
	you can use the "Zoom on chart view"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('zoominbutton').children[0].src;">)
	function. Clicking this button activates the area selection mode.
	Move the mouse cursor over the graph,
	click on the point that becomes the upper left corner of the area,
	and then click on the second point that becomes the lower right corner of the area.
	The program will then zoom in perfectly on the area you have selected.
</p>

<h3>Automatically zoom in on data</h3>

<p>
	To zoom in quickly and efficiently, press the "Zoom on data" 
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('zoomdatabutton').children[0].src;">)
	button. This function will automatically zoom in as optimally as possible on the recorded data,
	but still making sure that all of it is visible.
</p>

<h3>Zooming out on the data</h3>

<p>
	To cancel the current zoom, click on the "Resume Chart View"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('zoomresetbutton').children[0].src;">)
	button. This will restore the original chart view.
</p>

<h2>Table view</h2>

<p>
	The best option for accuracy. All measured values are entered in columns,
	where each sensor is assigned a separate column.
</p>
