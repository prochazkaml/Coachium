<h1>Connecting hardware</h1>

<p>
	To use Coachium for practical activities,
	you must have compatible hardware connected to your computer.
</p>

<p>
	Click the "Connect to device" button in the middle of the screen
	a window will appear where you can select your device that is compatible
	with Coachium (or you can select "Prochazka Inc." - "Dummy Driver",
	with which you can try the program, you will have access to 4 virtual sensors).
	Then click on "Connect to XYZ" in the bottom left corner of the window,
	to connect to the device. It is possible that the browser will prompt you,
	to confirm your connection to the device.
</p>

<p>
	If for any reason you would like to disconnect from the device,
	just click on the "Disconnect from device" button in the top right corner of the app.
	It can then reconnect by clicking the same button
	(it will be renamed to "Connect to device").
