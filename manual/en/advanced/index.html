<h1>Advanced options</h1>

<p>
	To get the most out of Coachium, you should know its advanced options.
	You can find them in the submenu "Advanced options"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedbutton').children[0].src;">).
</p>

<h2>Inserting notes</h2>

<p>
	To annotate the measured data
	(e.g. with the result of calculations based on the measured data),
	you can use the annotation function. Clicking on "Note Manager"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedpopup_notemgr').children[0].src;">)
	in the advanced options submenu will bring up a window to create new notes or edit existing ones
	(there can be almost an unlimited number of notes per record).
</p>

<p>
	To create a note, type the contents of your note in the text box to the right,
	Then click the "Create Note" button. The graph will go dark,
	move the mouse cursor to any point on the graph you want the note to point to,
	and press the left mouse button. The note will now be saved at this selected location.
</p>

<p>
	To move the note, select it in the list on the left in the Note Manager and click
	the "Move Note..." button on the right.
	Follow the same steps as if you were creating a new note.
</p>

<p>
	To change the text of a note,
	select it in the notes manager in the list on the left,
	edit its content in the text box on the right and click the "Save changes" button.
	The edited content will now be saved in the note.
</p>

<p>
	To delete a note,
	select it in the note manager in the list on the left and click
	the "Delete note" button on the right.
	The note will disappear from the chart and from the list.
</p>

<h2>Interleaving function</h2>

<p>
	Interleaving a recorded function curve is one of the most efficient methods of curve analysis.
	This method attempts to produce a curve expressed by a simple equation with
	a small number of parameters that is as close as possible to the input data
	(which is itself inaccurate, as it always contains some variation due to sensor inaccuracy;
	by interleaving the function, this variation can be eliminated to some extent given a sufficient number of samples).
</p>

<p>
	Clicking on "Interleave function"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedpopup_fitfunction').children[0].src;">)
	in the advanced options submenu will bring up a window where you can select
	which sensor you want to interleave and which function you want to interleave it with.
	Below the selection, the coefficients for calculating the function
	(if the selected function can be interleaved at all) and a button that,
	when checked, will display the function on a graph
	(or its corresponding values will be displayed in a table) will be listed.
</p>

<h2>Export to .csv or .svg files</h2>

<p>
	Use this function only if you want to display the results of your work outside of Coachium.
	You can either export the data measured from the selected record to a CSV table by clicking on the "Export table (.csv)"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedpopup_exportcsv').children[0].src;">)
	button, which will open any modern spreadsheet, e.g. LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel;
	or to an SVG image by clicking on the "Export graph (.svg)"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedpopup_exportsvg').children[0].src;">)
	button, which will open in InkScape, Adobe Illustrator, etc.
