<h1>Advanced features</h1>

<p>
	To get the most out of Coachium, you should know its advanced features.
	You can find them in the "Advanced features" submenu
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedbutton').children[0].src;">).
</p>

<h2>Inserting notes</h2>

<p>
	To annotate the measured data
	(e.g. with the result of calculations based on the captured data),
	you can use the note function. Clicking on "Note manager"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedpopup_notemgr').children[0].src;">)
	in the advanced features submenu will pop up a window for creating new notes or editing existing ones
	(there can be almost an unlimited number of notes per captures).
</p>

<p>
	To create a note, type the contents of your note in the text box on the right,
	then click the "Create new note" button. The graph will go dark,
	move the mouse cursor to any point on the graph where you want the note to point to,
	and press the left mouse button. The note will now be saved at your selected location.
</p>

<p>
	To move a note, select it in the list on the left in the Note manager and click
	the "Move note..." button on the right.
	Follow the same steps as if you were creating a new note.
</p>

<p>
	To change the text of a note,
	select it in the Note manager in the list on the left,
	edit its contents in the text box on the right and click the "Save changes" button.
	The edited content will now be saved in the note.
</p>

<p>
	To delete a note,
	select it in the note manager in the list on the left and click
	the "Remove note" button on the right.
	The note will disappear from the chart and from the list.
</p>

<h2>Fitting a function</h2>

<p>
	Fitting a function onto a captured curve is one of the most efficient methods of curve analysis.
	This method attempts to recreate the curve with a simple function with
	a small number of parameters that is as similar as possible to the input data
	(which is itself inaccurate, as it always contains some variation due to sensor inaccuracy;
	by fitting a function, this variation can be eliminated to some extent given a sufficient number of samples).
</p>

<p>
	Clicking on "Fit function"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedpopup_fitfunction').children[0].src;">)
	in the advanced features submenu will pop up a window where you can select
	which sensor you want to fit to and which function you want to fit it with.
	Below the selection, the coefficients for calculating the function
	(if the selected function can be fitted at all) and a button that,
	when checked, will display the function on the chart
	(or its corresponding values will be displayed in a table).
</p>

<h2>Exporting to .csv or .svg files</h2>

<p>
	Use this function only if you want to display the results of your work outside of Coachium.
	You can either export the captured data from the selected capture to a CSV table by clicking on the "Sheet export (.csv)" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedpopup_exportcsv').children[0].src;">),
	which will open any modern spreadsheet, e.g. LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel;
	or to an SVG image by clicking on the "Chart export (.svg)" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('advancedpopup_exportsvg').children[0].src;">),
	which will open in InkScape, Adobe Illustrator, etc.
