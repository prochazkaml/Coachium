<h1>Saving and loading work</h1>

<p>
	If you've finished your work and want to save it, you have a choice:
	you can either save it directly to your computer or to your Google Drive.
</p>

<h2>Save to your computer</h2>

<p>
	To save the file to your computer, press the "Save workbook to computer"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('savebutton').children[0].src;">)
	button. A window will pop up where you can name your saved work,
	click the "Save" button and the file will be downloaded to the folder on your computer where you normally download files.
</p>

<h2>Saving to Google Drive</h2>

<p>
	Saving files to Google Drive is very similar to saving to your computer,
	you just need to click on the "Save workbook to Google Drive"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('savegdrivebutton').children[0].src;">)
	button.
</p>

<p>
	After naming it and clicking "Save",
	a window will pop up outside of your browser asking you to log into your Google account.
	Follow the on-screen prompts, and if all is successful,
	a window will appear in Coachium with a link to the saved file on your Google Drive.
</p>

<h2>Loading your work</h2>

<p>
	To load a paper, you must already have it saved on your computer
	(unfortunately, it is not possible to load a paper from Google Drive).
	Click on "Upload a workbook from your computer"
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('openbutton').children[0].src;">)
	and select your saved file on your computer.
</p>

<p>
	If you have selected a file that was actually created in Coachium,
	all the records from your saved work will appear in front of you.
	If Coachium displays an error while loading the file,
	it is probably invalid (saved Coachium jobs have a ".coachium" extension).
</p>
