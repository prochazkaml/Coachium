<h1>Saving and loading work</h1>

<p>
	If you've finished your work and want to save it, you have a choice:
	you can either save it directly to your computer or to your Google Drive.
</p>

<h2>Save to your computer</h2>

<p>
	To save the workbook to your computer, press the "Save this workbook to your computer" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('savebutton').children[0].src;">).
	A window will pop up where you can set the name your saved file,
	then click the "Save" button and the file will be downloaded to the folder on your computer where your download files normally appear.
</p>

<h2>Saving to Google Drive</h2>

<p>
	Saving files to Google Drive is very similar to saving to your computer,
	you just need to click on the "Save this workbook to your Google Drive" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('savegdrivebutton').children[0].src;">).
</p>

<p>
	After naming it and clicking "Save",
	a window will pop up outside of your browser asking you to log into your Google account.
	Follow the on-screen prompts, and if all is successful,
	a window will appear in Coachium with a link to the saved file on your Google Drive.
</p>

<h2>Loading your work</h2>

<p>
	To load a workbook, you must already have it saved on your computer
	(unfortunately, it is not possible to load a workbook from Google Drive).
	Click on the "Open a workbook file from your computer" button
	(<img style="height: 16px; margin: 0 4px;" class="HELP_RUN_SCRIPT" script="thisel.src = get_id('openbutton').children[0].src;">)
	and select your saved file on your computer.
</p>

<p>
	If you have selected a file that was actually created in Coachium,
	all the captures from your saved file will appear in front of you.
	If Coachium displays an error while loading the file,
	it is probably invalid (saved Coachium workbooks have a ".coachium" extension).
</p>
